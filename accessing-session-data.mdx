This guide explains how to retrieve session data from the Roundtable API. There are two primary methods to access your data: by specific session ID or by user ID. For more detailed information on the API specification, see the [API Reference](api-reference).

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your secret API key:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

If you don't have a secret key, you can generate one at on your [account page](https://accounts.roundtable.ai/account) on the Roundtable dashboard.

There are two methods to retrieve session risk scores and flags:

## Method 1: Retrieve a a specific session

When you need data from a specific session, use the session ID to retrieve detailed information:

```
GET https://api.roundtable.ai/v1/sessions/{sessionId}/report
```

### Example request

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.roundtable.ai/v1/sessions/abc123def456/report \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```

This returns all Roundtable data for the specified session, including automatically generated user logs and failed security checks. The session ID can be found in session storage under `rtSessionId`. 

## Method 2: Retrieve all sessions for a user

To retrieve all sessions associated with a specific user:

```
GET https://api.roundtable.ai/v1/users/{userId}/sessions
```

### Example request

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.roundtable.ai/v1/users/user-123/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```

This returns an array of session data for the specified user. Each entry is an object consisting of the session data for that user. While in beta, this endpoint is limited to the most recent 100 sessions.

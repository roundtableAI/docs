Roundtable's verification badge is a small, drop-in widget that shows whether Proof of Human is running or not. It auto-renders wherever you place `<div class="roundtable-badge">`, listens to your tracker’s events, and gracefully handles SPAs and back-navigation.

Note that the badge does *not* display any results related to risk score. Instead, it determines rsuccess or failure based on whether the Roundtable tracking is working correctly.

<Note>
Roundtable's Terms of Service require you to include the Roundtable badge in at least one page where you are tracking user activity.
</Note>

## Quick start

We recommend adding the tracker and the badge script on the same page, with the badge script after the tracking script:

```html
<!-- Core tracker -->
<script
  src="https://cdn.roundtable.ai/v1/rt.js"
  data-site-key="YOUR_SITE_KEY"
></script>

<!-- Badge -->
<div class="roundtable-badge"></div>
<script src="https://cdn.roundtable.ai/v1/badge.js"></script>
```

After importing the badge script, the badge can be added anywhere by adding a div with the class `roundtable-badge`:

```html
<div class="roundtable-badge"></div>
```

## Styling

The badge renders inside a Shadow DOM, so your site’s CSS won’t break it (and vice-versa).

By default, the badge's width is `231px`. We recommend never setting the width less than this value. However, uou can control the badge width via a `width` attribute:

```html
<div class="roundtable-badge" width="300px"></div>
```

`width` takes any css width, e.g. `300px`, `100%`, etc.

## State

At any given time, the badge is in one of three states:

- **Loading** – shows a spinner and an animating progress bar while the tracker initializes verifies Roundtable is running.
- **Pass** – displays a check icon in black. This indicates that Roundtable is running and gathering user data.
- **Fail** – displays an X icon in red. This indicates that Roundtable is not running.

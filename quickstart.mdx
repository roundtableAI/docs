### Step 1: Sign Up and Get Your API Key

1. [Sign up](https://app.roundtable.ai/sign-up) for a Roundtable Alias account.
2. Log in and navigate to the [account dashboard](https://app.roundtable.ai/account).
3. Click "+ Create new API Key" and copy the API key.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Survey Data

To use Roundtable Alias, you'll need to collect the following data for each survey response:

- `participant_id`: A unique identifier for the respondent
- `survey_id`: A unique identifier for the survey
- `questions`: An object mapping question IDs to the text of each question
- `responses`: An object mapping question IDs to the respondent's answers
- `question_histories` (optional): Typing data for each question, collected using the [JavaScript tracker](custom-integration)
- `fingerprint_id` (optional): A unique identifier for the device session, collected using the [fingerprinting script](device-fingerprinting)

Ensure your data is formatted correctly before sending it to the API.

### Step 3: Make an API Request

Send a POST request to the Roundtable Alias API with your survey data:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.roundtable.ai/alias/v020 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'api_key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "fingerprint_id": "fp_789xyz",
    "participant_id": "p123",
    "survey_id": "s456",
    "questions": {
      "Q1": "How has our product improved your workflow?"
    },
    "responses": {
      "Q1": "It has made me hungry for pineapple pizza."
    },
    "question_histories": {
      "Q1": [
        [
          {"s":"I","t":0},
          {"s":"It","t":253},
          {"s":"It ","t":1290},
          {"s":"It h","t":1563},
          {"s":"It ha","t":1817},
          ...
        ]
      ]  
    }
  }'
```

### Step 4: Interpret the API Response

The API will respond with a JSON object containing fraud signals and effort scores for each question:

```json
{
  "error": false,
  "flagged": true,
  "num_checks_failed": 1,
  "response_groups": {
    "Q1": 1
  },
  "checks": {
    "Q1": [
      "Automated test: Off-topic"
    ]
  },
  "effort_ratings": {
    "Q1": 4
  },
  "typing_url": "<string>",
  "model": "alias-v020",
  "fingerprint_checks": {
    "device_id": "3pzig2Tu5GtqHY1Kh1p3",
    "duplicate": true,
    "error": false
  }
}
```

Review the `flagged`, `effort_ratings`, and `checks` fields to identify suspicious responses:

- `flagged`: `true` if the response failed any fraud checks, `false` otherwise
- `effort_ratings`: An object with effort scores (1-10) for each question, where 1 is low effort and 10 is high effort
- `checks`: An object listing the specific fraud checks failed for each question
- `fingerprint_checks`: An object listing the specific device fingerprinting checks for each session

Use this data to decide which responses to remove or investigate further.

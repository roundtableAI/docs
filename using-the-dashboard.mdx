The [Roundtable Dashboard](https://accounts.roundtable.ai) provides a central location to view all session data, investigate individual user sessions, and manage your Roundtable account settings.

## Viewing session data

Click on `Sessions` in the left-hand navigation bar to see a table of all recorded sessions. By default, this table lists:

- **Session ID** – The unique identifier automatically generated by Roundtable  
- **User ID** – The user identifier you provided (if any)  
- **Risk Score** – The numerical risk score (0-100) generated by Roundtable
- **Risk Explanation** – A brief description of why the risk score assigned to the session
- **Session Duration** – How long the session lasted
- **City** –  The user's city (inferred from their IP address)  
- **Country** – The user’s country (inferred from their IP address)  
- **Status** – Live or Complete, depending on whether there was any user activity within the last 30 minutes

Biometric checks
- **Programmatic typing** – The user enters text in an extremeley consistent way, consistent with programmatic entry
- **Teleporting mouse** – The user's cursor jumps large distances with no intermediate movement
- **No corrections** – A large amount of text is entered without any backspaces or correction events
- **All pasted** – All text is pasted or entered all-at-once

Device checks
- **Bot** – The browser fingerprint matches known automation frameworks such as Selenium and Playwright
- **Virtual machine** – Hardware and API signals show the browser is running inside a VM or sandbox
- **VPN** – The user's IP address belongs to a commercial VPN or hosting provider
- **TOR** – The user's connection is routed through a Tor exit node
- **Location spoofing** – The user's browser-reported GPS coordinates conflict with the IP-inferred location

### Viewing session details

Click on any session row to open a Session Overview modal. Here, you can view the risk scores, risk explanation, complete user action log, and biometric checks.

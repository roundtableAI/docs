## Basic Integration

Follow these steps to start detecting fraudulent responses in your surveys using the Roundtable Alias API.

### Step 1: Get Your API Key

1. [Sign up](https://app.roundtable.ai/sign-up) for a Roundtable Alias account.
2. Navigate to your [account dashboard](https://app.roundtable.ai/account).
3. Copy your API key. You'll use this to authenticate your API requests.

### Step 2: Implement Response Tracking

To enable Alias's advanced fraud detection, you'll need to track participants' typing behavior using our JavaScript library.

1. Include the Roundtable Alias tracker script on your survey pages:

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.roundtable.ai/alias/v1/tracker.js"></script>
   ```

2. Initialize the tracker for each open-ended question:

   ```js
   const questionId = 'Q1';
   const textareaElement = document.getElementById('textarea-Q1');
   
   RoundtableAlias.initializeQuestionTracker(questionId, textareaElement);
   ```

   The tracker will record the participant's typing patterns, pauses, and revisions as they answer each question.

### Step 3: Collect Survey Data

When a participant submits their survey, gather the following data to send to the Alias API:

- `participant_id`: A unique identifier for the participant
- `survey_id`: A unique identifier for the survey
- `questions`: An object mapping question IDs to the text of each question
- `responses`: An object mapping question IDs to the participant's responses
- `question_histories`: The typing data recorded by the tracker for each question

### Step 4: Call the Alias API

Send a POST request to the Alias API with your survey data:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.roundtable.ai/alias/v015 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'api_key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "participant_id": "p123",
    "survey_id": "s456",
    "questions": {
      "Q1": "How has our product improved your workflow?"
    },
    "responses": {
      "Q1": "It has streamlined my daily tasks significantly."
    },
    "question_histories": {
      "Q1": [...]
    }
  }'
```

### Step 5: Interpret the Results

The API will respond with a JSON object containing fraud signals and effort scores for each response:

```json
{
  "error": false,
  "flagged": true,
  "num_checks_failed": 1,
  "response_groups": {
    "Q1": 1
  },
  "effort_ratings": {
    "Q1": 3
  },
  "checks": {
    "Q1": [
      "Automated test: Low-effort"
    ]
  },
  "model": "alias-v015"
}
```

Review the `flagged`, `effort_ratings`, and `checks` data to identify suspicious responses and decide which to remove or investigate further.

## FAQ

### What API versions are available?

Alias offers multiple API versions with varying feature sets. The latest version is v021, which includes effort ratings, unnatural typing detection, and device fingerprinting. 

See the [API Reference](#api-reference) for details on all available versions.

### How do I choose an effort threshold?

The appropriate `low_effort_threshold` depends on your survey questions and data quality standards. We recommend starting with the default threshold (0) and adjusting based on your results. 

A lower threshold will flag more suspicious responses, while a higher threshold will reduce false positives. See [Customizing Effort Thresholds](#effort-thresholds) for more tips.

### Can I customize the fraud checks?

Alias provides a comprehensive set of fraud detection checks based on our research and data from millions of survey responses. 

If you have specific needs not met by our standard checks, contact us at support@roundtable.ai to discuss custom check development.

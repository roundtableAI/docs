Roundtable uses advanced behavioral analyses to help fraud teams quickly identify and respond to threats. Our API automatically generates detailed user logs and captures biometrics such as keystrokes, mouse movements, scrolling patterns, and focus changes. This monitoring provides real-time alerts for suspicious activities, letting security teams investigate potential fraud before it impacts their business.

### Getting Started
To start using Roundtable, follow these steps:

1. **Sign up for an account**: Create your Roundtable account at [accounts.roundtable.ai](https://accounts.roundtable.ai) to obtain your site key and access the dashboard.

2. **Integrate the tracker**: Add our JavaScript tracker to your site with a single line of code:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.roundtable.ai/v0.0/tracker.js" data-site-key="YOUR_SITE_KEY" data-user-id="OPTIONAL_USER_ID"></script>
   ```

3. **Access session logs**: Use our API to retrieve detailed user action logs and access session replays:
   ```
   GET https://api.roundtable.ai/v0.0/sessions/{sessionId}/report
   ```
   
4. **Review flagged activities**: Analyze suspicious behaviors identified by our system, including unnatural mouse movements, rapid changes in user information, and other fraud signals.

### Signup and Login

To start using Roundtable Alias, create your account:

1. Visit the [signup page](https://app.roundtable.ai/sign-up).
2. Fill in your email, choose a password, and provide your company information.
3. Click "Create Account" to complete the signup process.

Once your account is created, log in to your [dashboard](https://app.roundtable.ai/dashboard) to access your API keys and manage your subscription.

### API Key Management

Roundtable Alias uses API keys to authenticate your requests. To create and manage your API keys:

1. Navigate to the [account dashboard](https://app.roundtable.ai/account).
2. Click "+ Create new API key" to create a new API key.
3. Copy the generated key and store it securely. You won't be able to view it again.

*Best practices for API key management*:

- Use separate keys for different environments (development, staging, production).
- Regularly rotate your keys to maintain security. We recommend every 90 days.
- If a key is compromised, delete it immediately and generate a new one.

### Usage Tracking and Overages

Roundtable Alias tracks your API usage on a weekly and monthly basis. You can monitor your current usage on the [account dashboard](https://app.roundtable.ai/account).
